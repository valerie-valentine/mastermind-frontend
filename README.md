# Mastermind

## Mastermind Site Overview

The Mastermind site serves as a way to play the Mastermind code-breaking game. There are 3 pre-set difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), options to choose the range of digits in the code (i.e. 0-4 -> 0404), as well as the number of lives (max 20). Users will be able to receive feedback upon each guess, generate a hint or view previous guesses.

## Updates:
-  Added a landing page for site

## Prequisites
- yarn

## Additional Feautures
- Customizable difficulties (easy code = 4, medium code = 6, hard=8). 
- Users are able to choose from what range they would like the numbers to be generated from (i.e: 0-4 -> 0404). 
- Users are able to customize how many lives may be played (no less than 3 or more than 20). 
- Option to login/create a user profile that can save the games played and allow you to continue unfinished games, and view your past games data. 
- Ability to see previous guesses, instructions and feedback of guess. 
- Leaderboard that displays the top 10 players based off of most games won. 
- Ability for a user to delete a game or user account. 
- Ability to view a hint

Note: There is logic in the frontend to mitigate bad inputs, as well as logic on the backend to verify inputs and deals with errors.

## How to Run:
### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

    - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
    - Yarn (Package manager)
    - Backend server running at http://localhost:5000 (or update the URL accordingly in the .env file)
  

Create a .env file in the mastermind folder and add the following line:
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
Start the React app:
```bash
yarn start
```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
